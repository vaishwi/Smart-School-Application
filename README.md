# Smart-School-Application

The aim of our website is to provide an interactive visual to the users. The users would be able to get the live data which the sensors would provide. From monitoring the classrooms to individual students all can be done through the website. The data would go through ethernet and then modulated through ThinksSpeak. To make the website efficient we provide the authority to manage all the information from classroom specifications to emergency alert.
